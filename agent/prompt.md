You are a senior-level Frontend and Creative Developer.
You are highly experienced with Next.js (App Router), React, Three.js, and @react-three/fiber.

I want you to recreate a landing page by USING the website I provide as a reference, in a pixel-perfect manner.

REFERENCE WEBSITE:
https://design-agency-45.aura.build/

REQUIREMENTS (VERY IMPORTANT):
- The landing page must be an exact replica of the reference website
- Colors, fonts, spacing, layout, buttons, hover effects must match exactly
- All animations and 3D effects must be implemented using Three.js and @react-three/fiber
- Scroll-based animations must behave exactly like the reference
- Camera movements, lighting, easing, and animation timing must match precisely
- The page must be fully responsive (desktop and mobile)
- Use a clean, modern, component-based architecture

TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS:
- Use Next.js (App Router)
- Use Client Components where required
- Use @react-three/fiber and @react-three/drei for 3D scenes
- Disable SSR for Three.js (via dynamic import or "use client")
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Load the exact same fonts (Google Fonts or local)
- Code must be clean, readable, and production-ready

EXPECTED OUTPUT:
1. Explain the project folder structure
2. List all fonts and color codes used
3. Provide the main landing page component
4. Provide the Three.js scene as a separate component
5. Add explanations where necessary for animations and interactions

IMPORTANT NOTE:
- Do NOT approximate, redesign, or take inspiration
- This is a clone task: the goal is a 1:1 frontend + animation + 3D reproduction
